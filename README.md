# .dotfiles

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my dotfiles. This is a folder which I use, which autoupdates using softlinks.

The dotfiles contained in this repository are the following:

	- .bashrc
	- .bash\_profile
	- .vimrc
	- .Xresources
	- .tmuxrc
	- .xmonad.hs
	- .xmobarrc

My hopes for this repo is somewhat twofold. I'd like to first provide people some potential for inspiration, although
I realize that I really don't have the best dotfiles out there. I am just getting started. As such, I'd definitely also
appreciate any feedback or suggestions that people have.

Also, I am using this as more of a backup so I don't need to worry if my drives get corrupted. GitHub isn't a bad
place to back things up to, of this nature.

Thank-you for taking a read, it is much appreciated!
